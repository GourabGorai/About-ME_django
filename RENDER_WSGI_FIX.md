# Render WSGI Deployment Fix - Updated Solution

## Issue
The deployment was failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` because Render's auto-detection was running `gunicorn app:app` instead of our Django WSGI configuration.

## Root Cause
Render was using auto-detection and ignoring our custom `startCommand` in render.yaml, defaulting to `gunicorn app:app` which doesn't exist in a Django project.

## Solution: Compatibility Layer Approach

### 1. Created `app.py` Compatibility Layer
Created an `app.py` file that acts as a bridge between Render's auto-detection and our Django WSGI application:

```python
# app.py - Render compatibility layer
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'portfolio.settings')
from portfolio.wsgi import application
app = application  # Export for Render's gunicorn app:app
```

### 2. Simplified render.yaml
Removed complex startCommand and let Render use auto-detection with our compatibility layer:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: portfolio-django
    env: python
    buildCommand: "./build.sh"
    plan: free
    envVars:
      - key: SECRET_KEY
        generateValue: true
      - key: DEBUG
        value: "False"
      - key: ALLOWED_HOSTS
        value: "*"
      - key: DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
        value: "portfolio.settings"
```

### 3. Updated Build Process
- Removed Procfile (was causing conflicts)
- Renamed setup.py to local_setup.py (was confusing Render's detection)
- Made build script more resilient with error handling

### 4. How It Works
1. Render detects Python app and runs `gunicorn app:app`
2. Our `app.py` imports the Django WSGI application
3. Django application runs normally through the compatibility layer

## Verification
The build script now verifies both Django and the compatibility layer:
```bash
python -c "import app; print('app.py imported successfully')"
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes (especially the new `app.py` file)
2. Redeploy on Render
3. Render should now successfully run `gunicorn app:app` and find our Django application

This approach works with Render's auto-detection instead of fighting against it.
