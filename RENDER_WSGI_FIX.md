# Render WSGI Deployment Fix

## Issue
The deployment was failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` because Gunicorn couldn't properly locate the Django WSGI application.

## Root Cause
The error occurred because:
1. Gunicorn was trying to import 'app' instead of 'portfolio.wsgi'
2. Missing proper configuration for the WSGI application path
3. Potential Python path issues in the Render environment

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Gunicorn Configuration (`gunicorn.conf.py`)
- Added explicit Gunicorn configuration with proper binding and worker settings
- Configured for Render's environment with PORT variable support

### 2. Updated Deployment Files
- **render.yaml**: Updated startCommand to use gunicorn config and added environment variables
- **Procfile**: Updated to use the same gunicorn configuration for consistency
- **build.sh**: Added verification steps and made scripts executable

### 3. Added Verification Scripts
- **test_wsgi.py**: Tests WSGI application import before deployment
- **start.sh**: Startup script that verifies WSGI before starting Gunicorn

### 4. Environment Variables Added
- `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=portfolio.settings`
- `PYTHONPATH=/opt/render/project/src`

## Deployment Commands
The new deployment flow:
1. Build: `./build.sh` (installs deps, runs migrations, verifies WSGI)
2. Start: `./start.sh` (tests WSGI import, then starts Gunicorn)

## Verification
Before deployment, you can test locally:
```bash
python test_wsgi.py
```

This should output:
```
âœ“ Django imported successfully
âœ“ WSGI application imported successfully  
âœ“ Django setup completed successfully
ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! WSGI application should work correctly.
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Redeploy on Render
3. Monitor the build and deployment logs for any remaining issues

The deployment should now work correctly with proper WSGI application detection.
