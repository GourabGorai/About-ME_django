# ALLOWED_HOSTS Fix for Render Deployment

## Issue Fixed
The Django app was running successfully but returning HTTP 400 errors with:
```
Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'about-me-django.onrender.com'. You may need to add 'about-me-django.onrender.com' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
```

## Root Cause
The `ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable was set to `"*"` but Django's `Csv()` cast was not handling the wildcard properly.

## Solution
Updated Django settings to handle both wildcard and comma-separated values:

```python
# Before (problematic)
ALLOWED_HOSTS = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS', default='localhost,127.0.0.1', cast=Csv())

# After (fixed)
allowed_hosts_str = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS', default='localhost,127.0.0.1')
if allowed_hosts_str == '*':
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
else:
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = [host.strip() for host in allowed_hosts_str.split(',') if host.strip()]
```

## Environment Variable
The render.yaml now correctly sets:
```yaml
- key: ALLOWED_HOSTS
  value: "*"
```

## Status
✅ WSGI import issue: FIXED
✅ ALLOWED_HOSTS issue: FIXED
✅ App should now be accessible at: https://about-me-django.onrender.com

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes
2. Redeploy on Render
3. The app should now load without HTTP 400 errors
